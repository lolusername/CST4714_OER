# Week 15: Synthesis, Portfolio Writing, and Final Presentations

## The Week's Question

How do you explain database skill through a safe demonstration, reproducible
project, and specific interview story?

## What You Will Be Able to Do

- review a system through its model, queries, access, performance, and recovery;
- present a final project without exposing credentials;
- turn one course concept into a useful GitHub project;
- write a resume bullet and STAR-R interview story from work completed in class; and
- identify one next skill without overstating production experience.

## Before Class: Assigned Reading

Use [Chapter 15: Professional Communication Makes Technical Skill Visible](../../../Operating_Cloud_Databases.pdf#page=165).

- **Before Day 1:** read the system review, worked SQL explanation, and portfolio-concept sections. Use them to build the single in-class concept guide.
- **Before Day 2:** read the demonstration and interview sections. Choose an explanation that accurately describes your own completed work.

Bring one point you want clarified. Reading supports the in-class work; it does
not add a separate reading report. Optional textbook practice is not required
unless the weekly lab assigns it.

## Class Materials

- [Canonical final project](../../assignments/final_project.md)
- [Week 15 student deck](week_15_synthesis_careers.pptx)
- [Week 15 PDF handout](week_15_synthesis_careers.pdf)
- [Week 15 transcript](week_15_synthesis_careers_transcript.md)
- [Review notebook: Four Tickets, Two Different Totals](../../notebooks/09_synthesis_review.ipynb)
- [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lolusername/CST4714_OER/blob/main/course_materials/notebooks/09_synthesis_review.ipynb) for the review and optional final-lab example; save a working copy in Drive.

Click **Open in Colab** above, or download the notebook for local Jupyter.
It uses Python's SQLite library and synthetic records. Colab requires a Google
sign-in; no Atlas/Supabase account, database password, or package installation
is needed.

## Day 1: Integrated Review and Portfolio Project

Use **slides 1-18** alongside the review notebook and individual concept lab.

We start with four tickets and a dashboard whose staff counts do not equal its
backlog. In the review notebook, we trace the SQL result, test an assignment
change and rollback, compare the same facts as documents, and check why a restore
can have the right row count but a wrong value. The examples reconnect earlier
course skills without requiring several cloud connections.

Complete [Final lab: Teach one database concept in GitHub](lab_01_github_concept_artifact.md).

Use one example from the review or another course concept. A single README with
code examples is enough. Submit only its public or instructor-accessible URL and
the lab's one-sentence description. The notebook itself is not another submission.

## Day 2: Final Demonstrations and Career Translation

Use **slides 19-26** for demonstrations and translating project work into
specific professional explanations.

Present the final project according to the
[canonical final-project requirements](../../assignments/final_project.md). Use prepared,
redacted project material and a non-live fallback.

Then practice turning one project decision into a resume bullet and an interview
story. Keep it in your own notes or the concept artifact if useful. There is no
additional reflection submission.

For support with the lab's explanation, use [Writing About Database Decisions](../../assessments/critical_writing.md). It develops the response already included in your lab, not an additional assignment.

## Optional Industry Extension: Sixty-Second Interview Recording

This activity is optional, ungraded, and does not add a submission.

Record or write a sixty-second answer to: "Tell me about a database problem you
investigated." Use situation, your task, one technical action, observable result,
and reflection. Name one query, plan, policy test, restore check, or incident
result. Listen or reread once and remove unsupported claims such as
"production scale," "zero downtime," or "fully secure" unless your work
actually establishes them.

## Final Self-Check

You should be able to answer:

1. What did you build or investigate?
2. Which result shows it worked?
3. Which failure or bad state did you consider?
4. Which tradeoff did you accept?
5. What would you inspect next in production?
